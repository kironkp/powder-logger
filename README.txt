POWDER LOGGER

ga/projects/MERN CRUD Project/powder-logger/public/images/powder-logger-screenshot.png

Powder Logger is a simple snow day tracking app that lets you create ride reports. I built this app to be able to keep a diary of my days snowboarding this season. Users can create an account, sign in, and log conditions with Ride Reports. They can choose how good or bad conditions were and provide further details or things to remember from the day.
